Summary
=======

A set of tools to improve the comfort of using the [Ergast database](http://ergast.com/mrd) - Formula One results database.

Overview
========

The set consists of three tools:

1. [fetcher](fetcher/README.md) - keeps your copy of the DB dump up to date
2. [import](import/README.md) - allows you to import the database with some tweaks and integrity fixes
3. [views](views/README.md) - a collection of useful or interesting database views, aggregating certain statistics

Please refer to specific README files for details on the tools.

Requirements
============

These tools were developed with Unix systems in mind and are targeted at users who are not afraid of the command line. If you're semi-fluent in database administration, you'll manage.

For specific technical requirements, refer to README files of specific tools.

If you want to contact me about the application, you can drop me a private message on Reddit: /u/emkael (although I know it's not exactly rocket science to work out other means of communication, from the GitHub account alone). I'll do my best to help.

License
=======

lol, idk.

Do: use it, share it, mix it, modify it, analyse it - just leave some attribution.

Don't: sell it?
